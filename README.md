# Fire-Fighting-Robot
This project demonstrates the design and development of an autonomous robotic system capable of detecting fire and responding without human intervention. Using flame sensors and embedded control logic, the robot navigates toward the fire source and activates a water-based suppression mechanism.

The project highlights practical skills in embedded systems, robotics, and sensor-driven automation, with applications in safety and smart automation systems.
